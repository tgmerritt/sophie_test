# Sophie Test

You can check out a running version of [this project](https://sophie-digital-human-test.herokuapp.com/)

## About this Project

[UneeQ](https://www.digitalhumans.com) creates digital humans to help companies deliver brand-led customer experiences in the age of conversational AI. Without a face, conversational AI only delivers 45% of human communication - the remaining 55% is non-verbal (body language and facial expressions speak volumes!)

Our digital humans are powered via the web, with cloud-edge rendering taking care of the graphics-intensive process and a live stream to the customer's device handled via a JavaScript SDK. This is an implementation of a full digital human experience in Ruby on Rails.

## Project delivered as-is

This project is meant to help partners / developers quickly get a digital human live online. The project is not meant to be a drop-in production sample. There is no support express or implied for this repository. While we take care to ensure compatibility and update included gems from time to time for security reasons, you are encouraged to do your own due diligence on the gems included with this project. Neither myself nor UneeQ are responsible for any issues or trouble, damages or conflicts arising from your use of this project.

## Ruby on Rails

This application requires:

- Ruby 2.4.6p354 (2019-04-01 revision 67394) (but honestly it should work on most versions of Ruby supported by Rails 5 - I've only tested using the version indicated)
- Rails 5.2.3
